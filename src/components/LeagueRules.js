  {title: '1 About Action Dart League',content: `<p>Action Dart League was founded and created by dart players for dart players. In this soft tip dart league program, the players are the #1 priority. Benefits include larger payouts, localized league finals, and online player information (statistics and results). So, step up to the line for some great fun and action – we look forward to seeing you at the boards!</p>`},
  { title: '1.1 Player Guide', content: `<p>This guide is for the players and operators of Action Dart League to use and refer to as needed. These rules and guidelines are solely for the use of Action Dart League. Action Dart League reserves the right to refuse services or play to anyone not following the guidelines set forth.</p><p>It is Action Dart League’s belief that rules are in place to keep the spirit of the game on an even playing field. The rules will not be utilized to simply win a game. All teams are entered with the spirit of fair competition and good sportsmanship. Players not displaying these qualities may be removed from the league at Action Dart League’s discretion. Occasionally, during a season, a situation may arise that our current rules do not directly address. Action Dart League reserves the right to amend the rules during the season to properly address the fairness of competition and continued efficiency of the League.</p>`},
  {title: '1.2 Player Participation', content: `<p>A player may participate in Action Dart League events and league play by obtaining a player identification number through Action Dart League. A player must also play from a home location containing approved soft tip dart boards which meet the requirements to individually track player ratings. For further information on local operators and/or board requirements, contact an Action Dart League Representative.</p>`},
  {title: '1.3 League Fees', content: `<p>League Fees are due to the Operator prior to the start of the League. The League fees are $50 per team of doubles. Captains are responsible to collect fees and submit them to their ADL League Operator no later than the 1st week of league. Player fees paid after the 1st week of league will incur a $5 late fee per player. Any player with unpaid fees will not be allowed to participate in League finals or future seasons until fees are paid in full.</p>`},
  {title: '1.4 Fee & Incentive Guidelines', content: `<p>Sponsoring locations cannot pay league fees and or weekly match fees for the players. In addition, standings or finish bonuses are prohibited. Team shirts provided by the sponsoring location, however, are allowed and encouraged.</p>`},
  {title: '2 About Ratings',content: `<p>Players are assigned ratings based on ability and recorded stats through either a dart assessment program on a dart board (in conjunction with a dart operator), a previous permanent league rating, stats from an approved online dart machine (such as Phoenix or DARTSLIVE), or through statistics collected through a previous Action Dart League season.</p> <p>It is imperative for players to monitor their rating to maintain parity in the league. Ratings can be adjusted as necessary through a season, by the Operator, Player or Action Dart League. Players that deliberately alter their rating by throwing below their skill level to achieve a lower rating may be expelled from the league.</p> <p><strong>Example:</strong> In a game of cricket, a single bull is needed to finish the game and the player will purposely throw for singles on another number instead of taking the game out.</p> <p>It is also each Operator’s responsibility to police their players and their ratings throughout each season. If a player is thought to be deliberately keeping their rating down, it is the Operator’s responsibility to adjust that player to their fair rating to preserve the integrity of the game. Teams will all play within the “cap” of their combined ratings at the beginning of each season. We will address teams that excel far beyond their cap later in these rules.</p>`}, 
  {title: '2.1 New Players',content: `<p>New players to Action Dart League must obtain a Phoenix Official Players card and activate their free membership on their smartphone or other device. Using their new Phoenix card, they should play a minimum of 10 games of ‘501 and 10 games of Cricket against another player also using their Phoenix Players card, or online with VS MOVIE (on line remote play vs another player anywhere in the world, utilizing the Phoenix systems). This will give a fairly accurate depiction of their rating. (General Rating). New players may request for their beginning ADL League rating to be higher than their card stats if so desired as there is a “bust rule” for new players. New players typically will improve in their first season with new competition. It is natural to do so, which is why we actually encourage new players to begin at least 1 rating point above their current card rating prior to first league.</p>`}, 
  {title: '2.2 How to Participate in ADL League Finals',content: `<p>Players that have completed their league season will qualify for events (their specific league events, should they qualify, as well as all side events they are qualified for) at the season-ending League Finals. ADL players that have played within the last 2 ADL seasons may also participate in the League Finals side events. Any League Substitute must have played in the current league season.</p>`}, 
  {title: '2.3 Substitutions',content: `<p>When a player requires a substitute, it is common courtesy for the team to pay the game cost (nightly $15 coin drop fee) for the substitute. It is the responsibility of each Captain to ensure that a sub player on the opposing team fits the sub requirements prior to playing the match. In order for a player to be used as a sub on the Phoenix systems, the Local Operator must be contacted to confirm the legitimacy of the sub and add approved subs to the rosters on the Phoenix system. Scores will not be changed after a match has been completed, with the exception of ADL Official determining a gross abuse of the sub with purposeful intent to cheat.</p> <p>A substitute's rating may be equal to or lower than the current rating for the player they are subbing for, but not higher than the team flight cap (sub + attending player). All subs will use their current ADL Rating to qualify as a sub.</p> <p><strong>Example A:</strong> Flight Cap is 15. Player A’s current ADL rating is 9 and Player B’s current ADL rating is 7. Player (A) cannot play and will need a substitute. A and B combined ratings are 16 (1 over the cap), therefore, an acceptable rating for a substitute for Player (A) is an 8 or lower.</p> <p><strong>Example B:</strong> Flight Cap is 15. Player A’s current rating is an 8 and Player B’s current rating of 5. An acceptable rating for a substitute for Player (B) is a 5 or lower. Subs may be equal or lower to the missing player, but not to be higher than the original team cap. Essentially, a team should not be able to improve their team rating by bringing in a higher sub.</p> <p>Prior to Week 8, Replacement Players may be added to the roster if they are going to join the team and may be up to the team cap, considering the remaining players' Current ADL rating. Players may not substitute within the same division they play in.</p> <p><strong>Example:</strong> Player (A) may not sub on a direct opposing team in their division. Subs may ONLY be used to temporarily replace a player. If the rostered player requesting a sub is available and present at match time, the rostered player must play and the sub player may not. After week 8, a substitute must have a minimum of 48 games played with verifiable stats within the last 1 year. All these rules apply to substitutes at League Finals as well.</p>`}, 
  {title: '2.4 Ratings and Rating Responsibility',content: `<p>It is the responsibility of ADL operators and players to support the rating system set forth and to protect the parity in the league. The term “Sandbagger” is far overused. Players' abilities are set from an average of their league play throughout a season. At any given time, players can achieve better and or worse statistics than their rating indicates. The true definition of a “Sandbagger” is a player that purposefully throws off in order to maintain a lower rating. Players producing over their rating with their rating climbing as a result, are not sandbaggers. They are improving dart players and we encourage everyone to improve!!</p> <p>Previously (prior to Spring '22 season) ADL attempted a few different variations of “Roll Up aka Bust Rules” in order to try to maintain the integrity of the rating point caps. It became clear that those rules, regardless of how they were altered, would only “catch” players improving without “holding back” their rating in order to not “bust” or “roll up”. The intent of these rules was to maintain parity, while allowing teams that did over-achieve, to roll up into the division that their season-ending rating would have placed them. However, instead, it created a “ceiling” for players to play to and then hold back a little bit to remain in the cap they were competing in.</p> <p>We have determined that the presence of a “roll up” or “bust” rule actually creates the suggestion to sandbag. We have “rolled up” honest teams and they have quickly been dispatched in the upper league, essentially penalizing them for playing as well as they can. The simple fact is that those rules would never “catch” players that would purposefully be holding their ratings down, but would always catch and penalize honest players. This is not the spirit of the rules we want to operate within.</p> <p>SO, there is no longer a “bust” or “roll up” rule. We want all of our players to play to their full potential every time they step to the line. Never to hear “you’d better hold back or you’ll bust”. The one exception to this rule is temporary (new to ADL) players in their first season.</p>`}, 
  {title: '2.5 Temporary Players Roll Up Rule',content: `<p>We will hold a 2-point roll-up rule (cap) for Temp Players. <strong>Example:</strong> A Temp 7 can roll to a 9, however, if they roll to a 10 at the end of the season, their team will be moved to the next level at League Finals and compete in the Round Robin qualifier. Teams with a Temp Player rolling 3 or more above their entry at season’s end will not qualify for the $100 cash bonus for First in Division teams. They will compete in the Round Robin qualifier in the next level up at League Finals.</p> <p>Teams with Temp players that are on the brink of hitting the roll-up point, or having already hit the roll-up point, will be reviewed for the remainder of the season. If there is evidence of purposeful manipulation of stats or “sandbagging”, they may face penalties that could include a ban from the rest of the season and or future seasons. Temp players that hit the roll-up point, yet manage to roll back down prior to end of season, will very likely be “statted” at League Finals during their Round Robin and/or Championship tournaments. If said Temp player should roll above their end-of-season rating, ADL may elect to remove them from the tournament if abuse is clear.</p> <p>Step up to the line and throw your best darts every single week!!</p>`}, 
  {title: '2.6 Rating Responsibility',content: `<p>The responsibility of a player’s rating is ultimately: 1 – the player, 2 – the team captain, 3 – the operator.</p>`},
  {title: '3 Match Information', content: `<p>This area is very important for Operators and Players. All of the officially approved machines being used have internet capabilities and the ADL staff will be able to pull the match information and review matches that may be protested. There are times when matches are being played at a local level and others via online programming. Information here will pertain to all players with a very few exceptions regarding online matches. The specifics for online play will be detailed under <strong>3.7 Online Match Play</strong>.</p>`},
  {title: '3.1 Duties of the Captains', content: `<p><strong>Communicate with other captains to maintain an enjoyable season!!</strong></p> <p>It is imperative to practice common decency and mutual respect in regards to schedules, roster changes, etc. ALWAYS communicate with the other Captains as soon as possible to keep everyone informed of any schedule changes, rosters, etc. Here are a few recommendations as to how to communicate throughout the season:</p> <ul><li>Build a small FaceBook message link including all Captains.</li><li>Save each Captains phone number to your phone.</li><li>Create a text link of all Captains.</li></ul> <p>Bottom line – show respect to all by communicating any changes as soon as possible.</p><p>The team captain is responsible for the conduct of the team, attesting to the accuracy of the match score, properly adding and dropping players to the roster, and contacting team members with matches, league event, and playoff information.</p> <ol type="A"><li>All captains should provide contact information (telephone numbers and email addresses) for their team members to their Operator. It is the Operator’s responsibility to collect this information and provide this to ADL.</li><li>If teams are running late, the captains must notify the opposing team immediately. Teams are expected to be punctual and efficient to not make the opposing teams wait and/or reschedule unless a dire emergency exists. Operators are ultimately responsible for their teams. Operators with teams continuously conducting poor timing, attendance, or common courtesy, may be suspended from the league.</li><li>Coaching – see <strong>7.3 (F)</strong>.</li><li>All ADL teams are sponsored by their home locations. Therefore, all home matches must be played at the sponsoring location.</li><li>It is the captain’s responsibility each week, to confirm the players on the other team are the correct rostered players OR legal, approved substitute following the substitute rules in this document.</li><li>Only approved players may play during the matches. If a team allows a non-rostered, or out of turn player to throw, they are subject to losing that game. Repeat infractions may result in complete match forfeiture and/or removing the team from the division and possibly face a ban from the league.</li><li>No more than 2 matches may be postponed in a season without consent from the Operator and/or ADL.</li></ol> <p><strong>Important:</strong> A captain’s responsibility regarding the guidelines and questions about the guidelines must be addressed IMMEDIATELY. Once a match has been completed, it is deemed as final. If there is a question regarding a ruling, the match must be stopped, and the Operator contacted to make an official rule call prior to continuing. In a situation of rule dispute that cannot be immediately resolved, the match can complete “under protest or review”. This can only be done if the captains notify their Operator and ADL via voicemail, text message or email of the issue and the request to complete the match “under protest or review” prior to the completion of the match. The match may then continue, and a ruling made after the match ONLY in this situation.</p>`},
  {title: '3.2 Roster Management', content: `<p>Roster changes must be submitted to the team’s Operator within a timely manner, which is generally recognized as at least 24 hours prior to a match. While this may not always be possible, it is the sole responsibility of each team captain to make every attempt to operate within this guideline. Last-minute changes happen, but should be held to a minimum and are not guaranteed to be updated before the match starts. Roster changes are subject to ADL approval and will be randomly audited. No roster changes are allowed after week 10, so captains should confirm that their rosters are accurate prior to that point in the season.</p> <ol type="A"><li>Team members must have played a minimum of 48 games by the end of week 10 of the current season to remain on the active roster.</li><li>Players may not be added to any roster without their consent or knowledge.</li><li>Only players and approved subs rostered for each individual match may play the games in that match. Players MUST play in order (highest rated player in first spot, etc. with the exception of the singles games).</li><li>Teams may replace players up to the cap prior to week 8, using the remaining player’s current ADL rating or beginning rating, whichever is higher.</li><li>Prior to week 10, players can be replaced on the roster, but the missing player can only be replaced at original player’s entry rating or rating to match the cap of the flight. When adding a player prior to week 10, the upwards rolling rating for both players must be taken into consideration and the replacement player plus the original player may not exceed the team cap. <strong>Example:</strong> In an 18-point division, player A entered as a 12 and is rolling a 15. Player B entered as a 6 and is rolling a 5. Player B has a personal issue and is no longer able to play. Player B may be replaced with a 3 or less, to stay within the team cap.</li><li>At the completion of Week 10, teams may not be “rebuilt” above their current (Week 10) combined rating. <strong>Example:</strong> 15-point cap, team is 9 and 3. The 3 cannot play any longer, so player 9 must replace the 3-rated player. However, after Week 10, this example team may not improve their team cap they have been competing all season with (12 in this instance). So the 9-rated player must replace the missing 3-rated player with a new 3-rated player or less.</li><li>After week 12, players may not be replaced on any roster. A sub would then be used to complete the season (with a minimum of 48 games in the current season). The sub rating may not exceed the original flight cap or replaced player’s rating.</li></ol>`},
  {title: '3.3 League Score Sheets/Reporting Results', content: `<p>In extreme situations, such as wide-spread internet loss, matches may be played “on paper”. Both teams must agree to do this and your local operator should provide a score sheet. This is normally used as a last resort to get a match completed.</p>`},
  {title: '3.4 Match Scheduling (Pre-play, Forfeits, Postponements)', content: `<p>Match start times are scheduled prior to the start of the league season. Current start time is 6:00 pm on Sundays and 7:00 pm on weeknights. Starting on time is strongly recommended in order to avoid team conflict. If a team does not arrive at the start of match play and no call was made to reschedule, a forfeit may be called after waiting 30 minutes, however, all efforts must be made to make-up the match before a forfeit is called.</p> <p>There will be a 30-minute grace period before a forfeit should be called. If a forfeit is called on a team, the team receiving the forfeit will receive zero wins. The team that wins by forfeit will receive the number of wins based on their total win percentage (rounding up) or 51% of total match games played for that division, depending on which is higher.</p> <p><strong>Important:</strong> Any forfeits in the first 11 weeks of the season will result in a $40 fee to the operator by the team that is forfeiting. This fee will be $60 in week 12 and will increase in $20 increments for subsequent weeks. Fees collected in crossover divisions are to be split with the operator of the non-forfeiting team.</p>`},
  {title: '3.5 Dummy Scores & Replacing No Show', content: `<p>If at the start of the match a player is not present, the team can use the 30-minute grace period to find an approved sub or postpone match with approval of the opposing team. Should a team decide to play with only 1 player, the turn of the player that is not present MUST BE SKIPPED. “Iron Man” play (a single player playing both positions) IS NOT ALLOWED.</p>`},
  {title: '3.6 Flight Corking/Starting Your Match', content: `<p>When setting up the machines, players must wait until the machine’s notification to “Insert Coin/Credits” is showing. Any monies inserted prior to this will not be refunded.</p> <p><strong>C, CC, B and BB Cap Flights:</strong> The standard for beginning these flights is to perform a coin toss. However, if both Captains agree, a cork can be used to determine first to the board. ONLINE matches do not have beginning options. The machine will determine first to the board in the first game.</p>`},
  {title: '3.7 Online Match Play', content: `<p><strong>Flight Corking/Starting Your Match:</strong> Teams will always use the coin toss to determine which team will start the match. Many machines will have the home team starting the final match regardless of wins or losses. Unless there is a tie going into the last game of a match, the team that lost the previous game will go first. If the machine starts the wrong team in the first position, it can be backed out and the starting order corrected.</p> <p><strong>Dart Scoring:</strong> The “Unthrow”, “Correct-A-Dart” or other machine options are not available in online matches. Until a method is created by the manufacturers and approved by ADL, the machines are correct. In online matches if a dart is thrown prior to the machine changing over, it is considered a missed dart, regardless of if it sticks in the board or not. The player may not tap the dart to have it count or rethrow the dart. The dartboard is always correct. If a dartboard incorrectly scores a dart, that score stands. A player CANNOT manually score a dart if it does not count.</p>`},
  {title: '4 Results & Standings', content: `<p>All League information can be found on the Action Dart League website – <a href="http://www.actiondartleague.com">www.actiondartleague.com</a> – for schedules and results. It is the captain’s responsibility to regularly review information for accuracy and completeness. In the event of a discrepancy of results, captains must first contact their Operator to solve the issue. If a team is not satisfied with the resolution, the captain may contact ADL to confirm the resolution.</p> <p>99% of our Operators are now using the Phoenix platform for their dart leagues. Schedules are also available on your smartphone app. The Action Dart League website schedule is the primary source of schedules. Ratings can be found on the Phoenix app., however, those are Phoenix Ratings. ADL ratings are calculated strictly from each League Match and manually entered into the ADL website. There may be a slight difference in PPD / MPR from Phoenix to ADL in all divisions that have the “best of 3” singles matches in their format. The ADL system was created with only SINGLE GAMES in the formats. ADL elected to move to “best of 3” singles matches several years ago. However, the program for ADL still considers those matches to be single games, so the calculation is an average of the 2 or 3 games of each singles match instead of direct game-to-game statistics. The ADL ratings are the Official Rating used for Top 16, and ratings from season to season.</p>`},
  {title: '5 Playoffs & League Match Formats', content: `<p>Playoffs are scheduled on the same day/night as the regular season. Final standings determine playoff matches. Any ties are broken (placement determined) from head-to-head match scores during the season. If this results in a tie, then placement will be determined by head-to-head games won. In any unique situation where this still results in a tie, then placement will be determined by overall matches won. If this results in a tie still, then a playoff for a tie breaker will need to be played. Playoff format will follow the dartboard program.</p> <p><strong>Example of standings and playoffs:</strong> In a 6-team division - 1st place team automatically advances to Championship Bracket tourney at finals. 2nd place automatically advances to the Round Robin at finals. 3rd place team will have a playoff against the 6th place team. 4th place team will playoff against the 5th place team. Winners of the Playoff matches will advance to the Round Robin at finals.</p> <p>The final result of playoff matches will stand. If the winning team chooses not to attend the league finals, the opposing team will not advance in their place. If there are questions, contact your Operator or ADL representative.</p>`},
  {title: '6 League Finals', content: `<p>75% of the teams that complete the season will advance to the League Finals. First place in each division will advance directly to the Championship Bracket tourney and be “in the money” at the League Finals. First place teams that do not attend the League Finals will not receive any prize money from the Championship tournament. They will be able to claim their First Place bonus cash from their Operator after League Finals. Prize money not claimed within 2 weeks of League Finals will be forfeited. Second place teams in each division will advance to the League Finals qualifying Round Robin tournament. The local playoff winners will advance to the Round Robin qualifying tournament as well.</p> <p>Trophies that are presented are to go to the team’s sponsoring location.</p> <p>In order for a team to qualify for Playoff or League Finals, they must satisfy the minimum requirements: Doubles – 1 player with at least 60 games recorded on that team. Subs may be used in playoffs and League Finals. See 2.3 of this ADL rules guide.</p> <p>If a team utilizes a sub, that sub will play the entire event, regardless of whether the original player shows up or not. There may be extenuating circumstances and ADL reserves the right to amend the sub rule in the presence of a very good reason. A team may switch from sub to rostered player after Round Robin if a team qualifies through the Round Robin in the event of league conflicts. But sub MUST complete all of the Round Robin games, or Championship Bracket games. Once a sub starts either RR or Champ Bracket, the original player may not return.</p>`},
  {title: '7 General Information & Guidelines', content: `<p>This section provides general information and guidelines related to the operation of the league and player responsibilities.</p>`},
  {title: '7.1 Board Setup & Information', content: `<p>All team captains should be familiar with board set-ups prior to league matches. For instruction or assistance, check with your league operator. It is each team captain’s responsibility to be able to perform all league set-up at the machine, as well as corrections.</p>`},
  {title: '7.2 Accommodations', content: `<p>A player is allowed to use a device that would provide accommodation for league play. If the device is not listed below, contact an ADL representative.</p><ul><li>Wheelchair: The main axle must be behind the throwline.</li><li>Walker: The player’s feet must be behind the throwline; the support unit may cross the throwline.</li><li>Casts, etc: Foot or leg casts must be behind the throwline during the entire completion of the throw.</li></ul>`},
  {title: '7.3 Player Etiquette', content: `<p>Any violation of the following may result in an immediate suspension or ban from Action Dart League:</p><ul><li>A. Attempts to distract an opponent while they are shooting will not be tolerated. Heckling, chanting, or other harassment is strictly forbidden.</li><li>B. No verbal conversation towards the player at the line from the opposing team will be allowed.</li><li>C. Vulgar language towards a player or team member is not permitted.</li><li>D. A player may NOT practice on another board at any time once a game has begun and they are a part of that game. In the case of online matches, it is the captain’s responsibility to ensure this rule. Players may practice if their partner is playing a singles game.</li><li>E. Respect the time limits to throw – no more than 10 seconds between darts and no more than 30 seconds between player switches.</li><li>F. Players may NOT throw their darts until the player in front of them has returned beyond the player line. Players abusing this rule will be warned once, and then forfeit darts for each time throwing too soon. After 3 forfeited darts, the offending player will forfeit that game.</li><li>G. Coaching must remain between rostered teammates.</li><li>H. Players are responsible for the boards. If a board is damaged due to hitting, kicking, or negligence, the player is obligated to pay for the damages. NO EXCEPTIONS.</li><li>I. Use common sense, enjoy the game, and have fun!</li><li>J. Good sportsmanship should be the prevailing factor during all league competition.</li><li>K. In any cases of violation of the above etiquette rules, the Operator must be consulted immediately. Stop the match until the proper etiquette has been returned or the Operator makes a ruling.</li></ul>`},
  {title: '7.4 General Guidelines', content: `<p>Lunging – Players stand at the throwline, 96 inches horizontally from the face of the dartboard. It is legal to lean over the line – and players can step on, but not across, the line. Lunging is not allowed. On a thrown dart, the dart must make contact with the board before the player’s foot makes contact with the floor in front of the throwline. Anything other than that would be defined as lunging.</p><p>Dart Scoring:</p><ul><li>Local – If a dart has miss-scored, captains may use “Unthrow” or “Correct-A-Dart” (or other dart correction option offered on the dart machine) to correct the score. A dart that sticks in the board, but does not score, can be manually scored as long as both captains acknowledge where it is at prior to pulling the dart from the board. A dart that scores but does not stick in the board, counts. A dart that clearly contacts a segment, bounces out, and does not score is deemed to be a missed dart.</li><li>If a dart is thrown prior to the machine changing over, but does not stick or score, it is a missed dart. If a dart is thrown prior to the machine changing over and does stick; it is up to the opposing captain on whether they will allow the dart score or not. In either situation, this is considered the first dart thrown and the player only has 2 more throws.</li><li>If the machine is operating incorrectly, the two team captains will decide whether to play, call for service, or make up the match. Most of the machines used in ADL league play can move a match from one machine to another in the same location and continue play. This may only be done when both captains agree.</li></ul><p>Online Matches: See 3.7</p><p>Use of player pictures – ADL may post photographs of league, playoff, finals, and other tournaments on the ADL website, Facebook, or other social media platforms. By competing in ADL, players authorize use of photographs. If a player would like to “opt-out” and request that no photographs be posted with their likeness, contact an ADL representative.</p><p>All Matches are to be played AT the location scheduled. In emergency situations, matches may be moved to another ADL approved location, ONLY with the Operator's consent. The league schedules are traditionally scheduled with an equal number of home and away matches for each team. The host locations pay a sponsor fee for each team and reserve the sole right to have the team play at the hosted location as scheduled. Matches MAY NOT be played in any other location other than a location within the schedule of each team. In the case of dispute between host location and team, the Operator must approve any moves and ADL must be notified of the move.</p>`},
  {title: '7.5 Dartboard Malfunctions', content: `<p>If a machine resets due to a power failure or other reasons beyond player control, the game will be replayed from the start or depending on the machine, where the match left off. If a board malfunctions, move to an alternate board at that match’s location. If there is no other board available, contact your operator for alternatives. As previously stated, many machines used for ADL leagues do have the ability to continue a match.</p>`},
  {title: '7.6 Age Requirements', content: `<p>It is the player’s responsibility to know the local laws and rules of the locations. If an individual is under the age limit of an establishment, then they are not allowed to play at that location. No player under the age of 11 will be allowed to play. Minors (under 15) are only allowed to play in Jr/Adult. Youth players between the ages of 15-18 may play. A parent or legal guardian must be in attendance during the matches and at League Finals. There is a possibility that players under 21 may not attend a League Finals facility if the League Finals Host location does not allow under 21 years old in their facility. It is the responsibility of the Parent or players under 21, to inquire as to the accessibility of the League Finals for players under 21.</p>`},
  {title: '7.7 Dress Code', content: `<p>Dress must be appropriate and in good taste. The following are not deemed appropriate: half-shirts, halter tops, bare feet. ADL has the right to determine appropriate attire at major events.</p>`},
